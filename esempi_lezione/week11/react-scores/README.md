# `react-scores` project

This project contains a simple example of a React application for recording the scores you got with your exams.

It will be developed in phases, in several weeks, to illustrate the different features of React.

* _Phase 1_: just static component rendering, and props-propagation. Uses 'fake' data and does not allow any user interaction (except one).
* _Phase 2_: add a form and its management.
* _Phase 3_: edit form and client-side routing. The application now has 3 different pages.
* _Phase 4_: load/save data from/to server.
