# `react-scores` project

This project contains a simple example of a React application for recording the scores you got with your exams.

It will be developed in phases, in several weeks, to illustrate the different features of React.

* _Phase 1_: just static component rendering, and props-propagation. Uses 'fake' data and does not allow any user interaction.
